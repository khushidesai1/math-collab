## MathCollab
Experimented with AWS Amplify, GraphQL and Slate.js editor to create a collaborative editor that allows inserting math equations. Editor lets you share a link with peers for them to collaborate on the same note. 

Note: experiment is still in progress -- not a finished product.

### Possible Future Features
- Allow user to type math in MathQuill editor for ease and insert it into Slate.js
- Delete links from DynamoDB database after certain amount of days (make links temporary)
- User login features
